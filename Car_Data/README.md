# Car Data Analysis In Excel

In this data we have two sheets: <br/>
1st sheet: It has [Ad ID,	Car_Name,	Make,	Make Model,	Year,	KM_driven,	Price] <br/>
2nd sheet: It has [Ad ID,	Fuel,	Registration_city,	Car_documents,	Seller_Location,	Description	Assembly,	Transmission,	Condition] <br/>

In order to make informed analysis, I combined data from both:

Some of the questions that I we can answer from this analysis are: <br/>
+ what is the avg price of CNG models in suzuki?
    * 816,292.93
+ how many local, automatic models in Honda in Lahore?
    * 304
+ what is the total of all the prices of imported, manual cars in Karachi?
    * 342,497,996
+ what is the difference between avg price of a local car and avg price of an imported car?
    * 325,987.80
+ what is the percentage of CNG cars in the dataset?
    * 2.128
